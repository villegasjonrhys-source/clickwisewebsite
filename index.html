    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In today’s digital generation, social media has become part of students’ everyday lives. 
        While it allows communication and access to information, it also brings problems such as fake news, cyberbullying, and misuse of personal data. 
        Many students are not fully aware of the consequences of irresponsible online behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our mission is to educate students to become responsible digital citizens by providing reliable information and practical tips. 
        Our vision is to create a school community where students use social media safely, respectfully, and responsibly.
